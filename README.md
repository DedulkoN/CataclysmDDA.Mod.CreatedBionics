## CataclysmDDA.Mod.CreatedBionics

Game mod for the ability to create bionics.

Requires game version 0.G. Updates are planned about once a week when reworking the bionics system.

Recipes may change when the mod is rebalanced.

I will be glad to suggestions and feedback.


## Installation

1. Copy the folder "CreatedBionics" and all its contents to "../data/mods/".
2. Enable the mod when creating the world.
3. Enjoy yourself.
